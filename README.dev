Adding or modifying code:
=========================
- If you add new code, best practice is to write a test for it.
- If you're modifying code that doesn't have a test and you can write a test
  for it, please do.
- Before committing your changes to a python file, please make sure it passes
  pylint with:
pylint --rcfile=pylintrc yourfile.py
- If pylint raises a warning or error that you don't agree with, it's probably
  better to just change your code. If you're sure you have a good reason for
  doing what you're doing, you can add an exception to our pylintrc.

Creating a release:
===================
Note: We are using VERSION="0.3.0" simply as an example.

- Run Gentoolkit's test suite, make sure it passes:
Note: requires dev-python/snakeoil
./setup.py test

- Create a tag for the release
svn copy svn+ssh://<dev>@svn.gentoo.org/var/svnroot/gentoolkit/trunk/gentoolkit \
         svn+ssh://<dev>@svn.gentoo.org/var/svnroot/gentoolkit/tags/gentoolkit-0.3.0 \
	 -m "Tagging the <VERSION> release of gentoolkit."
svn update to pull the tag from subversion
cd to the local tags/gentoolkit-0.3.0 directory

- Create a source distribution (you need to add VERSION here, too):
VERSION="0.3.0" ./setup.py sdist
Transfer dist/gentoolkit-0.3.0.tar.gz to dev.gentoo.org:/space/distfiles-local

- Clean up temporary files:
./setup.py clean -a
