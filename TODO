equery:
	Tests:
		+helpers2 (FileOwner._extend_realpaths test probably doesn't clean up)
	Run pylint and write test to run pylint
	Write test to compile all modules (full syntax check). Take from portage.
	Add more --debug stuff
	Write tests for Dependencies._parser
	Refactor each module to be useful for import. Done modules:
		+depends
		+belongs
		+meta
		+changes
		+depgraph

Ebuild changes:
	- Add:
		src_test() {
			"${python}" setup.py test || die "testing returned non zero"
		}
	- Add:
		DEPEND on python 2.5 (needed for 'from __future__ import with_statement' and others)

For Next Release:
	- write NEWS file
    - make CPV.__init__ more strict, it allows some silly stuff
	-  $ equery uses '>=sys-apps/portage-2'
	  * Searching for >=sys-apps/portage-2 ...
	  * Found these USE flags for sys-apps/portage-2.1.6.13:
	- belongs doesn't properly match atom syntax


For following release:
	- transition package query backend to using Query class.
	  Query class should accept any kind package of input accepted by equery.
	  Most of the functions in helpers should be able to moved out, either in
	  to query (many of those functions pertain to finding packages matching a
	  query) or into other appropriate modules (split_cpv,
	  compare_package_strings into cpv, as they also requires a cpv string)
