MOTIVATION

Update the KEYWORDS in an ebuild.

MECHANICS

N/A

IMPROVEMENTS

- Should we allow users to pass in */-*/~*?
- Should we collapse multiple globs into one.
- Should we support multiline KEYWORDS values?  No...
- Support autodetection of ~user homedir expansions.
  e.g. If "arm" is a user, then "~arm" will be passed in as "/home/arm".
       We should catch that and normalize it back to "~arm".
