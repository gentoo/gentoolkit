	* Add support for reqular expression matching for file names in the
	  exclude files.

2005-08-28 Thomas de Grenier de Latour (tgl) <degrenier@easyconnect.fr>
	* Version 0.4.1
	* added support for some "eclean-dist" and "eclean-pkg" symlinks on eclean
	  (and thus refactored command-line parsing and help screen code)
	* accept file names in exclude files for specific distfiles protection
	  (useful to protect the OOo i18n files for instance, which are not in
	  $SRC_URI but put there manually)
	* minor rewrite of some findDistfiles() code
	* added /usr/lib/portage/pym python path, just to be sure it comes first
	  (after all, "ouput" is a pretty generic name for a python module...)
	* updated manpage

2005-08-27 Thomas de Grenier de Latour (tgl) <degrenier@easyconnect.fr>
	* Version 0.4
	* added exclusion files support
	* added time limit option
	* added size limit option (for distfiles only)
	* added fetch-restricted distfile optionnal protection
	* added --package-names option for protection of all versions of installed
	  packages.
	* removed support of multiple actions on command-line. That would have been
	  hell with action-specific options.
	* updated manpage
