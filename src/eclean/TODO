- exclusion file syntax could be improved (maybe it should support real
   dep-atoms, or wildcards, etc.)

- some policy to keep the X latest versions of a package (in each of its 
   SLOT maybe) would be really cool...

- add an option to protect system binary packages
   => yup, but later... (needs some portage modifications to be done right)

- add actions for PORT_LOGDIR and/or /var/tmp/portage cleaning?
   => bah, don't know... imho tmpreaper or find+rm onliners are enough here

- cleanup of DISTDIR/cvs-src when action=distfiles
   => i never use cvs ebuilds, i should check what it does exactly

- rewrite for a decent Portage API if there ever is one
