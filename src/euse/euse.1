.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
.I euse
is used to set(disable/enable) USE flags in /etc/make.conf without having to edit
the file directly. It is also used to get detail information about use flags
like description, status of flags(enabled/disabled), type of flag(global/local)
etc.
.SH "OPTIONS "
.TP 
\fB\-E, \-\-enable\fI
Enables USE flag(s) in make.conf. It accepts one or more space seperated 
USE flags as parameters.
.TP 
\fB\-D, \-\-disable\fI
Disables USE flag(s) in make.conf. Puts a '\-' sign in front of the USE flag
and appends it to the USE setting in make.conf. It accepts one or more 
space seperated USE flags as parameters.
.TP 
\fB\-P, \-\-prune\fI
Removes USE flag(s) in make.conf. Removes all positive and negative references to
the given USE flags from make.conf.
.TP 
\fB\-i, \-\-info\fI
Prints detail information about the USE flag(s). If no arguments are given then
it assumes you want information for all USE flags. If one or more
arguments are given (space separated) then only information for those flags is
printed.
.TP 
\fB\-I, \-\-info\-installed\fI
Same as \-\-info, except that it will also list the currently installed packages that are utilizing the flag.
.sp
.RS
The output is in the following format:
.br 
\fB[\- cD ]\fI alpha \- indicates that architecture ...
.br 
\fB[\-   ]\fI moznocompose (net\-www/mozilla):
.br 
Disable building of mozilla's web page composer 
.br 
The indicators in the first column are:
.IP is_active
+ if the flag is seen as active by portage, \- if not
.IP is_in_env
E if the flag is enabled in the environment, e if it is
disabled in the environment, nothing if it's not affected
by the environment
.IP is_in_make_conf
C if the flag is enabled in make.conf, c if it is
disabled in make.conf, nothing if it's not affected
by make.conf
.IP is_in_make_defaults
D if the flag is enabled in make.defaults, d if it is
disabled in make.defaults, nothing if it's not affected
by make.defaults
.IP is_in_make_globals
G if the flag is enabled in make.globals, g if it is
disabled in make.globals, nothing if it's not affected
by make.globals
.br 
Then follows the name of the flag, for local flags the
package name and then the description (on a new line for
local flags).
.TP 
\fB\-a, \-\-active\fI
Shows all currently active USE flags and where they are activated (see 
description for \fB\-\-info\fI).
