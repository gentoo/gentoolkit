# Default revdep-rebuild configuration file
#
# revdep-rebuild no longer uses hardcoded paths. To change the default 
# behavior the following variables can be changed:
#
# LD_LIBRARY_MASK - Mask of specially evaluated libraries
#
# SEARCH_DIRS - List of directories to search for executables and libraries
#	Use this for directories that are not included in PATH or ld.so.conf.
#	An application should normally not have to set this variable
#
# SEARCH_DIRS_MASK - List of directories to not search
#	Use this for directories that should not be searched by revdep-rebuild
#	This is normally used by binary packages such as openoffice-bin
#
# Note: This file is sourced using bash by the revdep-rebuild script

LD_LIBRARY_MASK="libodbcinst.so libodbc.so libjava.so libjvm.so"
SEARCH_DIRS="/bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /lib* /usr/lib*"
SEARCH_DIRS_MASK="/lib*/modules"
