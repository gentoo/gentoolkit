List all packages owning a particular set of files

Note: Normally, only one package will own a file. If multiple packages own the same file, it usually consitutes a problem, and should be reported.

Syntax:
  belongs <local-opts> filename
<local-opts> is either of: 
  -c, --category cat - only search in category cat
  -f, --full-regex   - supplied query is a regex
  -e, --earlyout     - stop when first match is found
