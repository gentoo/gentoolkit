This tool scans libraries and binaries for broken shared lib dependencies
and fixes them by re-emerging those broken binaries and shared libraries.

It is a temporary stop-gap measure to fix installations that break when a
core-library needs to be upgraded along with all its dependencies. Hopefully
we will not need this when we get reverse dependencies into portage.
