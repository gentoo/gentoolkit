.SH "NAME"
revdep\-rebuild \- Gentoo: Reverse Dependency Rebuilder
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B revdep\-rebuild
[OPTIONS] [\-\-] [EMERGE OPTIONS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
revdep\-rebuild scans libraries and binaries for missing shared library dependencies and fixes them by re\-emerging those broken binaries and shared libraries.  It is useful when an upgraded package breaks other software packages that are dependent upon the upgraded package.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-X | \-\-package\-names
emerge the best packages available, not neccessarily the exact version of the installed package
.TP      
.B \-\-library=NAME
emerge packages that use the named library. Name can be a full path to a library or basic regular expression. (See man grep for the definition of basic regular expressions)
.TP 
.B \-nc | \-\-no\-color
turn off colored output (This option is also passed to the emerge command)
.TP 
.B \-i | \-\-ignore
ignore temporary files from previous runs
.TP 
.B \-q | \-\-quiet
be less verbose (This option is also passed to the emerge command)
.TP 
.B \-vv | \-\-extra\-verbose
be extra verbose (currently prints the revdep\-rebuild search environment)

All other options are passed to the emerge command
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
revdep\-rebuild no longer uses hardcoded paths. To change the default behavior the following variables can be changed by the user.

LD_LIBRARY_MASK \- Mask of specially evaluated libraries
.LP 
SEARCH_DIRS \- List of directories to search for executables and libraries
.LP 
SEARCH_DIRS_MASK \- List of directories to not search

These variables can be prepended to either by setting the variable in your environment prior to execution, by placing an entry in /etc/make.conf, or by placing a file in /etc/revdep\-rebuild containing the appropriate variables.

The variables are read and set in the following order:

environment settings \- one time changes by user
.br 
/etc/make.conf \- persistant changes by user
.br 
/etc/revdep\-rebuild/* \- persistant changes by ebuild authors

While a user can edit and modify the files in the /etc/revdep\-rebuild directory, please be aware that the /etc/revdep\-rebuild directory is not under configuration protection and files can be removed and/or overwritten by an ebuild. To change this add /etc/revdep\-rebuild to the CONFIG_PROTECT variable in /etc/make.conf.

An entry of "\-*" means to clear the variable from that point forward.
Example: SEARCH_DIRS="/usr/bin \-*" will set SEARCH_DIRS to contain only /usr/bin

revdep\-rebuild honors the NOCOLOR and PORTAGE_NICENESS variables from /etc/make.conf
.SH "EXAMPLES"
It is recommended that when running revdep\-rebuild that the following command be used initially:
.br 
\fBrevdep\-rebuild \-\-ignore \-\-pretend\fR

To search the entire system, while excluding /mnt and /home:
.br 
\fBenv SEARCH_DIRS="/ \-*" SEARCH_DIRS_MASK="/mnt /home" revdep\-rebuild\fR

To rebuild packages that depend on libkdecore.so.4 from KDE 3.3:
.br 
\fBrevdep\-rebuild \-\-library /usr/kde/3.3/lib/libkdecore.so.4\fR

To rebuild packages that depend upon libImlib.so and libImlib2.so:
.br 
\fBrevdep\-rebuild \-\-library libImlib[2]*.so.*\fR

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
revdep\-rebuild returns a zero exit status if it succeeds.
Non zero is returned in case of failure.
.SH "BUGS"
.LP 
In exact ebuild mode revdep\-rebuild can fail to properly order packages, which are not up to date.
.br 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23018
.LP 
Rebuilding using \-\-package\-names mode should be default, but emerge has no feature to update to latest version of a defined SLOT.
.br 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4698

\fBNote:\fR The ability to update to the latest version of a slotted package has been added to revdep\-rebuild.  However, it is possible for this feature to still not work 100% correctly
.LP 
Does not correctly handle interactive emerge commands.
